            <li>Divide 1/4 of the batter into each mug and top each with 8 mini marshmallows or 1 large marshmallow. Divide the remaining batter into each mug and top each with 8 mini marshmallows or 1 large marshmallow.</li>
            <li>Microwave the mugs for 1 minute to 1 minute 15 seconds, watching towards the end to make sure the cakes don't overflow.</li>
